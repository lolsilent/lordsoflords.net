How was this game made?
</th></tr><tr><td>
Allot time and read all the guides of the programs listed above.I started with a Perl game that took 3 weeks to build then I decided to take a look at other programming languages when PHP4 came,I knew this was my language when I saw there documentation.Downloaded the program for IIS and manuals,while I was converting and reading the manuals how to use the commands,it took me 3 days to have a php game running. Now I have invested more than 6 months studying PHP I almost know every command. It's still useless if you know the commands but don't know how to use them,so I sometimes takes a look at the guide too.
<p>
This game has been expanded to a huge game that now Contraventionains more than 50 files about with a total size of 248KB without templates and images.<a href="https://thesilent.com">blablablabla.....</a>
