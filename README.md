lordsoflords.net text based rpg game

text based browser game made back then I was learning html, perl, ftp, shtml the basic website making tools back then.

then iw ent from all that to php 4 to php 5 now its already php 7 and im getting too old for this stuff and dont want
put more time in it so hope some can this my code for something.

beside playing games i really loved making browser games.

most is just copy and paste from the php.net manual to see what the function does back then.
most stuff is outdated or deprecated maybe.

no means its professional or OO programming i was just playing around with it.
with in mind that each script should or must function when one script dies after an deprecated, update or something.

good luck.



easy start for windows users:

download WAMP.
install WAMP.
use php7.
change mysql root password.
insert mysql user and table.

open port 80 on router.
register or forward domain to your computer tada done.
